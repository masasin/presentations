## Summary
- Came for Masters instead of taking job offer
- Research student until start of academic year
- Masters student since April 2014
- Research topic approved in October 2014
- Research topic switched completely in mid-2015
  - Graduation delayed due to that <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## As a research student
- First exposure to research environment
- Masters entrance exam prep (I passed!)
- Got familiar with the lab
- Scipy stack
- Basics of ROS

Note:
- Research env:
  - How to find papers
  - How papers are written
  - Requirements for something to be called research
- Scipy stack: incl Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib etc. KSP project


### As a Masters student
- First six months were classes
- Participated in Robocup Japan Open (rescue robotics)
  - Software lead for Yozakura
- Worked on original research topic
  - Framework for controlling external devices using EMG
  - Heavy development, but no good publishing ideas
  - After many meetings, switched to current topic
- Currently working on third person view for drones
  - Codename: SPIRIT

Note:
- Original research
  - Used off-the-shelf EMG sensor
  - Goal was multiple types of input devices



# Yozakura



# SPIRIT



# Programming
- **C++** was introduction to programaming
  - Personal use with Arduinos
- **C** used for data structures, RTOS, FPGA, ÂµController
- **Octave**/Matlab for many courses, like numerical methods
- **LaTeX** for reports, **gnuplot** for graphing, **bash** for Linux
- One-offs (3-4 months each) include:
  - VHDL, PLC, LabVIEW (courses) 
  - VBA, C#, Perl, LISP (work terms)
- First learnt **Python** to help solve a task at work
- Delved into Python
  - Best practices
  - Scipy stack (numpy, matplotlib etc)
  - Various projects (*e.g.*, a KSP solver)
- Basics of ROS
