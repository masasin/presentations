- Research student until start of academic year
- Masters student since April 2014
- Research topic decided in October 2014
- Research topic switched completely in mid-2015
  - Graduation delayed due to that <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## As a research student
- First exposure to research environment
- Prepared for Masters entrance exam
- Learned my way around lab
- Delved into Python
  - Best practices
  - Scipy stack (incl Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib etc)
- Basics of ROS

Note:
- Research env:
  - How to find papers
  - How papers are written
  - Requirements for something to be called research



# Programming
- **C++** was introduction to programaming
  - Personal use with Arduinos
- **C** used for data structures, RTOS, FPGA, ÂµController
- **Octave**/Matlab for many courses, like numerical methods
- **LaTeX** for reports, **gnuplot** for graphing, **bash** for Linux
- One-offs (3-4 months each) include:
  - VHDL, PLC, LabVIEW (courses) 
  - VBA, C#, Perl, LISP (work terms)
- First learnt **Python** to help solve a task at work
- Delved into Python
  - Best practices
  - Scipy stack (numpy, matplotlib etc)
  - Various projects (*e.g.*, a KSP solver)
- Basics of ROS
